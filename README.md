# My customised blog theme

This is a fork of comfusion's beautiful [after-dark](https://github.com/comfusion/after-dark) theme, customised for my personal needs.

# Adjustments

* Switched from [hack.css](http://hackcss.com/) dark to light
* Changed main highlight color to #00F
* Added code highlighting for R with highlightjs
* Added MathJax compatibility
* Added code toggle
